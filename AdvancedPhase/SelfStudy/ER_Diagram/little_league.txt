In the little league entity-relationship assignment I created tables of Player, Guardian, Coach, and Team.


The Player table has foreign keys of team_id, coach_id, and guardian_id due to each player having at least one of each of those entities.

The Guardian table has a foreign key of player_id due to each guardian having at least one player.

The Coach table has foreign keys of team_id and player_id due to a coach having at least one team and at least one player.

The Team table has foreign keys of player_id and coach_id due to a team having at least one coach and at least one player.
